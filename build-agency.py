"""Build the ai.digitalise.agency variant of this site from this same source tree.

One source, two targets. salmanadnan.com ships this tree as-is; ai.digitalise.agency
ships this tree with the transforms below applied. There is deliberately no second
branch and no second copy of the site: a branch would drift and every homepage edit
would need cherry-picking. This script IS the diff.

The build is written to a scratch directory OUTSIDE the repo, so no generated file
can ever be committed by accident.

What the transform does, and what it refuses to do:

  Chrome (title, meta, nav brand, footer, back-links, structured data) becomes
  Digitalise Agency. Body-copy credits keep Salman Adnan's name, reframed as
  "our founder, Salman Adnan", because those sentences are attribution of who
  actually did the work. Re-attributing a three-person university course project
  to a company would be a false claim, and PROJECT_STANDARDS.md does not allow it.

  The legal pages MUST swap the operating entity. Per the owner directive in
  terms.html (2026-07-16), the entity for salmanadnan.com is "Salman Adnan, an
  individual" and the entity for ai.digitalise.agency is "Digitalise Agency".
  Two sites operated by two entities cannot both claim the same operator.

  Canonical and og:url are NOT rewritten. Every page keeps its canonical pointing
  at salmanadnan.com so Google consolidates ranking onto the personal site instead
  of the two competing. Only sitemap.xml and robots.txt carry the agency host.

The guard at the end is the load-bearing part. It fails the build if the personal
identity leaks into agency chrome, if first-person copy survives, or if a NEW
"Salman" context appears that nobody has classified yet. Without it, a future edit
to index.html silently ships "Digitalise Agency" saying "I've built".
